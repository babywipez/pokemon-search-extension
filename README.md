# Pokemon Search Tool

This tool will allow you to search for Pokemon using the PokeAPI.
A successful search will show you an image of the Pokemon, its
dynamically colored typing, and its stats, including its Base
Stat Total (BST).

This application is styled in such a way that it can easily be
added as a Chrome extension and used quite intuitively.
